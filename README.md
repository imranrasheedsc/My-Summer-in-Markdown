# My-Summer-in-Markdown

<p> My name is Imran i am a 10th grader at Chatsworth High School. During the Summer I went to New York City and stayed with famnily and had a good time. The most memorable experience I had was going to the statue of liberty in person in New York City, it looked way bigger in person compared to it portrayed in photos Some goals I have for this upcomming school year are to get all 5's on my AP tests and get all A's in my classes. I played tennis over the summer and tried to improve my skills. I hope to learn Java in this computer science class. </p>
